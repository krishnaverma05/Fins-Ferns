*Intelligent Aquaponics Automation integrates advanced computer vision and IoT technology to create a smart, sustainable agricultural system. By combining fish farming (aquaculture) with soil-less plant cultivation (hydroponics), our system uses natural fish waste as nutrients for plants, significantly reducing water usage and eliminating chemical fertilizers. Real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making optimize growth conditions, ensuring superior plant and fish production. This innovative approach addresses critical issues in traditional farming and fish farming, promoting environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.
